## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
examples of:
== is Equal to
// === strict equal to
!= is not equal to
!== strict not equal to

## Logical Operators
Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
- && operator tests more than one condition
- || operator tests at least one condition
- ! operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it

## Loops
Loops check a condition. If it is true, a code block will run. Condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. 

## Three common loop types:
- For *If you need to run code a specific number of times*
- While *If you do not know how many times the code should run, you can use a while loop.*
- Do While *similar to the while loop, the key difference, it will run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition evaluates to false*

## Loop Counters
- Initialization *create variable and set it to 0.*
- Condition *The loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number.*
- Update *every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter.*
