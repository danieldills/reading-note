## CSS Layout (Duckett HTML book)
- Building Blocks CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. The box will either be block-level or inline box.
- Containing Elements if one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element

### Controlling the position of elements (pg 363-64)
- CSSS has these positioning schemes
    - Normal Flow every block-level element appears on new line
    - Relative positioning moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom or left of where it would have been placed
    - Fixed positioning form of absolute positioning
    - Floting elements allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box

- Screen sizes visitors to your site will have different screen sizes, thus giving each of them a different experience, you need to be able to work on a range of sizes
- Resolution some devices have higher resolution 
- Page sizes 
- Fixed width layouts don't change as the user increases/ decreases the size of their browser
- Liquid layouts streth and contract as the user increases/ decreases the size of their browser
- Layout Grids
