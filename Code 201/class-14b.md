## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

This NY Times article was an interesting read on how groups work and what makes them more successful than others. Here's a hint, it's not the most individual itelligence, in one group that makes a group more intelligent. It's being able to feel open to speak your part, free from being judged or fearing it. I was surprised at how much research has gone into this type of research, with knowing that the information is out their to be consumed and readily available, I had wished I had encountered more of this thinking. 

Being in Code Fellows, I have found a group of classmates where I think we fit this mold very well. Everyone has a voice, anyone can ask questions, and there's always someone there to help out, normally a different person from the last. I have found this group set-up extremely effective in helping me so far. I'm very thankful to be in a group simliar to what is talked about in the NY Times article.
