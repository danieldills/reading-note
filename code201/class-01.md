### HTML

### Chapter 1
HTML describes the structure of pages. HTML uses elements when describing the structure of pages. Elements are made up of tags, with each element having an opening and closing tag (<></>) . Attributes give us more information, appearing at the opening of the tag and are made up of two parts: a name and a value separated by an equals sign. 

Body, head, and Title are examples of elements. Everything inside the body element is shown inside main browser window. Before the body, you'll likely see the head, which contains information about the page. The title contents are shown in the top of the browser.
