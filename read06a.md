## Making sense of HTML, CSS, & JacaScript
Three languages used to create web pages:
- HTML *gives pages structure and adds semantics*
- CSS *enhances HTML w/ rules and manipulates how HTML content is displayed*
- JavaScript *changes how the page behaves*

## HTML + CSS + JavaScript form the basis of building web pages
- JavaScript is written in plain text

### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow.
### Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement

### What is a variable?
- Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime. [source](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/javascript/javascript-variable#:~:text=Variable%20means%20anything%20that%20can,must%20have%20a%20unique%20name.)
