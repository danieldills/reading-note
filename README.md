## About Me
### Hello! My name is Daniel Dills. Prior to joining Code Fellows, I was an Army Civilian employee after serving in the United States Navy. I've always been interested in tech and I'm so happy to be pursuing a career as a software engineer.
### When I'm not in class you can find me and my family out exploring on one of the many hiking trails in the PNW or taking a road trip to discover new places.
