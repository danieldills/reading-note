This is my repo for my codefellows reading notes.

# Hello! My name is Daniel Dills. Prior to joining Code Fellows, I was an Army Civilian employee after serving in the United States Navy. I've always been interested in tech and I'm so happy to be pursuing a career as a software engineer.

# When I'm not in class you can find me and my family out exploring. On one of our many hiking trails in the PNW or taking a road trip to discover new places.

## Growth Mindset
__Simply put, Growth Mindset is the belief that you continue to learn and evolve your your capabilities.__

- View challenges as opportunities
- Replace *failing* with *learning*
- Celebrate accomplishments of myself and others
