# Linked Lists

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

There are two types of Linked List [source](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html):

- Singly: Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.

- Doubly: Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.

- Node: Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.

- Next: Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.

- Head: The head is reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.

- Current: The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

### Traversal

When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing. The Next property is exceptionally important because it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately. [source](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)

The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop. This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null. If we accidentally end up trying to traverse on a node that is null, a NullReferenceException gets thrown and our program will crash/end. [source](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html)

When traversing through a linked list, the Current variable will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end.

Traversal Example

Letâ€™s talk out what exactly is happening[source](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/resources/singly_linked_list.html):

- We are first creating Current at the Head to guarantee we are starting from the beginning. (Remember that Head is always the first node in a Linked List)

- We create a while loop. This loop will only run if the node that Current is pointing to is not null. This also means we can guarantee that we are still looking at a Node while the loop is running.

- Once we are in the while loop, we are checking if the value of the current node is equal to the value we are looking for. Given the logic, if that condition is true, then we have found the value we were looking for, so we return true.

- If the Current node does not contain the value we are looking for, we then must move Current to the next node that is being referenced. Again, because the condition of this while loop is to only run if we are still at a node, we can safely traverse to the next node without fear of getting a NullReferenceException.

- At this point, the while loop is re-evaluated. Step 3 & 4 will continue until Current reaches the end of the LinkedList. We will know we are at the last node in the linked list because the current node will be null. Once this condition becomes true, the while loop breaks, and we now know that we are at the end.

- Once we hit the end, we know that we did not find the value and return true at any point, so the value is not in the LinkedList. We return false.
