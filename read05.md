# Design web pages w/ CSS

## Chapter 10: Introducing CSS

- Imagine there are invisible boxes around HTML elements.
- CSS allows you to create rules that control each individual box (and contents) are presented.
- CSS associates style rules w/ HTML elements.
- CSS allow you to manipulate how elements are displayed
*CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).* [source](https://skillcrush.com/blog/css/#:~:text=CSS%20stands%20for%20Cascading%20Style,layouts%2C%20colors%2C%20and%20fonts%20are)

## Chapter 11: Color

- CSS can manipulate color properties like:
Foreground Color *color of text inside an element*
Background color *CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color of that box
Contrast *allows you to adjust the contrast of an image*
Opacity *allows you to specify opacity of an element*
