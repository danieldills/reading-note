### What is Node.js?

- "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine."

- "Node.js is an event-basded, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library."

### Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

1. Check to see if Node is installed on your system by opening terminal and typing ```node -v``` 

2. Intalling a Package Globally ```npm install -g jshint```

3. Installing a Package Locally ```npm init -y``` 

4. ```npm install lodash --save```

### What is Node.js Used For?

Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.
