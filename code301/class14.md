## Things I want to know more about

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
Personal computers began being marketed towards men, leaving out women almost entirely. The story highlights a commercial for a PC, one in which all the individuals were men, except for one woman.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
"In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis  (Links to an external site.)interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University, which had one of the top programs in the country. She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers." source (Links to an external site.) 

Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies (Links to an external site.)
What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
The make-up of individuals in tech is not made up of the demographics of the US. It's made up of White Men according to the data. This is even though women make up nearly half of demographics. This isn't just tech, but the companies show they hire less women and less minorities. The disparity is glaring!

Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company (Links to an external site.)
When are diversity efforts most successful?  Why do diverse companies perform better?
I think there's several instances when it's most successful but the part I found fascinating is when a company is made up of a diverse employee pool, they automatically serve a more diverse user base. I think most companies would look at that fact alone and think, why aren't we making a push to be more diverse? Yet, they are still lagging. Also, research of banking institutions found that ones that were more diverse, were more successful financially. How is this not the a good enough reason for change?

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
"Walker & Company CEO Tristan Walker recently observed (Links to an external site.): "If more black people were building features or striking partnerships at Twitter, perhaps they’d have a great idea" for more effectively engaging black users. " source (Links to an external site.) 

I spoke to it in a previous answer but more diverse companies can speak to a more diverse user base.
