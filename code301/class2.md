## State and Props

### Stat and Lifecycle
- Converting a function to a class [source](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)
    1. Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
    2. Add a single empty method to it called render().
    3. Move the body of the function into the render() method.
    4. Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
    5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.
- Adding lifecycle methods to a class
    - You can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts.

- Using state correctly
    - Do not modify state directly
    - use ```setState()``` instead
- State updates may be asynchronous
- State updates are merged

### Handling Events
[source](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html)
- Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:
    - React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
    - With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
- Passing arguments to event handlers

```
<button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button>
```

- Conditional Rendering
[source](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html)
    - In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

- Element Variables
    - You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesnâ€™t change.

- Inline If with Logical && Operator
    - You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator. It can be handy for conditionally including an element
- Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator
    - Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator condition ? true : false.
