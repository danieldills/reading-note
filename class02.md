# What are IDEs?

## An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of
different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file
manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package. [source](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)

# The Command Line

### The command line is a text interface for your computer. It’s a program that takes in commands, which it passes on to the computer’s operating system to run. From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer, just as you would with Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac OS. The difference is that the command line is fully text-based. [source](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/command-line-commands)

## Basic Command Line prompts
- pwd *current working directory*
- cd *change directory*
- ls *list directory contents*
- ls -la *list of detailed directory contents, including hidden files*
