# Django CRUD and Forms

[source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms)

Overview

An HTML Form is a group of one or more fields/widgets on a web page, which can be used to collect information from users for submission to a server. Forms are a flexible mechanism for collecting user input because there are suitable widgets for entering many different types of data, including text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, date pickers and so on. Forms are also a relatively secure way of sharing data with the server, as they allow us to send data in POST requests with cross-site request forgery protection.

While we haven't created any forms in this tutorial so far, we've already encountered them in the Django Admin site — for example, the screenshot below shows a form for editing one of our Book models, comprised of a number of selection lists and text editors.

HTML Forms
First a brief overview of HTML Forms. Consider a simple HTML form, with a single text field for entering the name of some "team", and its associated label:

Simple name field example in HTML form

The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside <form>...</form> tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit".

```html
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```

While here we just have one text field for entering the team name, a form may have any number of other input elements and their associated labels. The field's type attribute defines what sort of widget will be displayed. The name and id of the field are used to identify the field in JavaScript/CSS/HTML, while value defines the initial value for the field when it is first displayed. The matching team label is specified using the label tag (see "Enter name" above), with a for field containing the id value of the associated input.

The submit input will be displayed as a button (by default) that can be pressed by the user to upload the data in all the other input elements in the form to the server (in this case, just the team_name). The form attributes define the HTTP method used to send the data and the destination of the data on the server (action):

- action: The resource/URL where data is to be sent for processing when the form is submitted. If this is not set (or set to an empty string), then the form will be submitted back to the current page URL.
- method: The HTTP method used to send the data: post or get.
  - The POST method should always be used if the data is going to result in a change to the server's database because this can be made more resistant to cross-site forgery request attacks.
  - The GET method should only be used for forms that don't change user data (e.g. a search form). It is recommended for when you want to be able to bookmark or share the URL.

The role of the server is first to render the initial form state — either containing blank fields or pre-populated with initial values. After the user presses the submit button, the server will receive the form data with values from the web browser and must validate the information. If the form contains invalid data, the server should display the form again, this time with user-entered data in "valid" fields and messages to describe the problem for the invalid fields. Once the server gets a request with all valid form data, it can perform an appropriate action (e.g. saving the data, returning the result of a search, uploading a file, etc.) and then notify the user.

Django form handling process

Django's form handling uses all of the same techniques that we learned about in previous tutorials (for displaying information about our models): the view gets a request, performs any actions required including reading data from the models, then generates and returns an HTML page (from a template, into which we pass a context containing the data to be displayed). What makes things more complicated is that the server also needs to be able to process data provided by the user, and redisplay the page if there are any errors.

Validation

Django provides numerous places where you can validate your data. The easiest way to validate a single field is to override the method clean_<fieldname>() for the field you want to check. So for example, we can validate that entered renewal_date values are between now and 4 weeks by implementing clean_renewal_date() as shown below.

Update your forms.py file so it looks like this:

```py
import datetime

from django import forms

from django.core.exceptions import ValidationError
from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")

    def clean_renewal_date(self):
        data = self.cleaned_data['renewal_date']

        # Check if a date is not in the past.
        if data < datetime.date.today():
            raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal in past'))

        # Check if a date is in the allowed range (+4 weeks from today).
        if data > datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=4):
            raise ValidationError(_('Invalid date - renewal more than 4 weeks ahead'))

        # Remember to always return the cleaned data.
        return data
```

URL configuration

Before we create our view, let's add a URL configuration for the renew-books page. Copy the following configuration to the bottom of locallibrary/catalog/urls.py.

```py
urlpatterns += [
    path('book/<uuid:pk>/renew/', views.renew_book_librarian, name='renew-book-librarian'),
]
```

View

As discussed in the Django form handling process above, the view has to render the default form when it is first called and then either re-render it with error messages if the data is invalid, or process the data and redirect to a new page if the data is valid. In order to perform these different actions, the view has to be able to know whether it is being called for the first time to render the default form, or a subsequent time to validate data. 

For forms that use a POST request to submit information to the server, the most common pattern is for the view to test against the POST request type (if request.method == 'POST':) to identify form validation requests and GET (using an else condition) to identify the initial form creation request. If you want to submit your data using a GET request, then a typical approach for identifying whether this is the first or subsequent view invocation is to read the form data (e.g. to read a hidden value in the form).

The book renewal process will be writing to our database, so, by convention, we use the POST request approach. The code fragment below shows the (very standard) pattern for this sort of function view.

```py
import datetime

from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.urls import reverse

from catalog.forms import RenewBookForm

def renew_book_librarian(request, pk):
    book_instance = get_object_or_404(BookInstance, pk=pk)

    # If this is a POST request then process the Form data
    if request.method == 'POST':

        # Create a form instance and populate it with data from the request (binding):
        form = RenewBookForm(request.POST)

        # Check if the form is valid:
        if form.is_valid():
            # process the data in form.cleaned_data as required (here we just write it to the model due_back field)
            book_instance.due_back = form.cleaned_data['renewal_date']
            book_instance.save()

            # redirect to a new URL:
            return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('all-borrowed') )

    # If this is a GET (or any other method) create the default form.
    else:
        proposed_renewal_date = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(weeks=3)
        form = RenewBookForm(initial={'renewal_date': proposed_renewal_date})

    context = {
        'form': form,
        'book_instance': book_instance,
    }

    return render(request, 'catalog/book_renew_librarian.html', context)
```

First, we import our form (RenewBookForm) and a number of other useful objects/methods used in the body of the view function:

- get_object_or_404(): Returns a specified object from a model based on its primary key value, and raises an Http404 exception (not found) if the record does not exist.
- HttpResponseRedirect: This creates a redirect to a specified URL (HTTP status code 302).
- reverse(): This generates a URL from a URL configuration name and a set of arguments. It is the Python equivalent of the url tag that we've been using in our templates.
- datetime: A Python library for manipulating dates and times.
